# FUNDAMENTALS
Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. 
These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.

Rather than keeping files on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device, 
cloud-based storage makes it possible to save them to a remote database. As long as an electronic device has access to the web,
it has access to the data and the software programs to run it.

Cloud computing is a popular option for people and businesses for a number of reasons including cost savings, 
increased productivity, speed and efficiency, performance, and security.
